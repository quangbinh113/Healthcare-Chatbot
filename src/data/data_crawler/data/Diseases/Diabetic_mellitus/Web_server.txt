A web server is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP  or its secure variant HTTPS. A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by making a request for a web page or other resource using HTTP, and the server responds with the content of that resource or an error message. A web server can also accept and store resources sent from the user agent if configured to do so.
The hardware used to run a web server can vary according to the volume of requests that it needs to handle. At the low end of the range are embedded systems, such as a router that runs a small web server as its configuration interface. A high-traffic Internet website might handle requests with hundreds of servers that run on racks of high-speed computers.A resource sent from a web server can be a pre-existing file  available to the web server, or it can be generated at the time of the request  by another program that communicates with the server software. The former usually can be served faster and can be more easily cached for repeated requests, while the latter supports a broader range of applications.Technologies such as REST and SOAP, which use HTTP as a basis for general computer-to-computer communication, as well as support for WebDAV extensions, have extended the application of web servers well beyond their original purpose of serving human-readable pages.This is a very brief history of web server programs, so some information necessarily overlaps with the histories of the web browsers, the World Wide Web and the Internet; therefore, for the sake of clearness and understandability, some key historical information below reported may be similar to that found also in one or more of the above-mentioned history articles.In March 1989, Sir Tim Berners-Lee proposed a new project to his employer CERN, with the goal of easing the exchange of information between scientists by using a hypertext system. The proposal titled "HyperText and CERN", asked for comments and it was read by several people.  In October 1990 the proposal was reformulated and enriched , and finally, it was approved.Between late 1990 and early 1991 the project resulted in Berners-Lee and his developers writing and testing several software libraries along with three programs, which initially ran on NeXTSTEP OS installed on NeXT workstations:


Those early browsers retrieved web pages from web server using a new basic communication protocol that was named HTTP 0.9.In August 1991 Tim Berner-Lee announced the birth of WWW technology and encouraged scientists to adopt and develop it. Soon after, those programs, along with their source code, were made available to people interested in their usage. In practice CERN informally allowed other people, including developers, etc., to play with and maybe further develop what it has been made till that moment.  This was the official birth of CERN httpd. Since then Berner-Lee started promoting the adoption and the usage of those programs along with their porting to other OSs.In December 1991 the first web server outside Europe was installed at SLAC . This was a very important event because it started trans-continental web communications between web browsers and web servers.In 1991-1993 CERN web server program continued to be actively developed by the www group, meanwhile, thanks to the availability of its source code and the public specifications of the HTTP protocol, many other implementations of web servers started to be developed.In April 1993 CERN issued a public official statement stating that the three components of Web software , along with their source code, were put in the public domain. This statement freed web server developers from any possible legal issue about the development of derivative work based on that source code .At the beginning of 1994, the most notable among new web servers was NCSA httpd which ran on a variety of Unix-based OSs and could serve dynamically generated content by implementing the POST HTTP method and the CGI to communicate with external programs. These capabilities, along with the multimedia features of NCSA's Mosaic browser  highlighted the potential of web technology for publishing and distributed computing applications.In the second half of 1994, the development of NCSA httpd stalled to the point that a group of external software developers, webmasters and other professional figures interested in that server, started to write and collect patches thanks to the NCSA httpd source code being available to the public domain.  At the beginning of 1995 those patches were all applied to the last release of NCSA source code and, after several tests, the Apache HTTP server project was started.At the end of 1994 a new commercial web server, named Netsite, was released with specific features.  It was the first one of many other similar products that were developed first by Netscape, then also by Sun Microsystems, and finally by Oracle Corporation.In mid-1995 the first version of IIS was released, for Windows NT OS, by Microsoft. This marked the entry, in the field of World Wide Web technologies, of a very important commercial developer and vendor that has played and still is playing a key role on both sides  of the web.In the second half of 1995 CERN and NCSA web servers started to decline  because of the widespread adoption of new web servers which had a much faster development cycle along with more features, more fixes applied, and more performances than the previous ones.At the end of 1996 there were already over fifty known  web server software programs that were available to everybody who wanted to own an Internet domain name and/or to host websites. Many of them lived only shortly and were replaced by other web servers.The publication of RFCs about protocol versions HTTP/1.0  and HTTP/1.1 , forced most web servers to comply  with those standards.  The use of TCP/IP persistent connections  required web servers both to increase a lot the maximum number of concurrent connections allowed and to improve their level of scalability.Between 1996 and 1999 Netscape Enterprise Server and Microsoft's IIS emerged among the leading commercial options whereas among the freely available and open-source programs Apache HTTP Server held the lead as the preferred server .In those years there was also another commercial, highly innovative and thus notable web server called Zeus  that was known as one of the fastest and most scalable web servers available on market, at least till the first decade of 2000s, despite its low percentage of usage.Apache resulted in the most used web server from mid-1996 to the end of 2015 when, after a few years of decline, it was surpassed initially by IIS and then by Nginx. Afterward IIS dropped to much lower percentages of usage than Apache .From 2005-2006 Apache started to improve its speed and its scalability level by introducing new performance features . As those new performance improvements initially were marked as experimental, they were not enabled by its users for a long time and so Apache suffered, even more, the competition of commercial servers and, above all, of other open-source servers which meanwhile had already achieved far superior performances  since the beginning of their development and at the time of the Apache decline were able to offer also a long enough list of well tested advanced features.In fact, a few years after 2000 started, not only other commercial and highly competitive web servers, e.g. LiteSpeed, but also many other open-source programs, often of excellent quality and very high performances, among which should be noted Hiawatha, Cherokee HTTP server, Lighttpd, Nginx and other derived/related products also available with commercial support, emerged.Around 2007-2008 most popular web browsers increased their previous default limit of 2 persistent connections per host-domain   to 4, 6 or 8 persistent connections per host-domain, in order to speed up the retrieval of heavy web pages with lots of images, and to mitigate the problem of the shortage of persistent connections dedicated to dynamic objects used for bi-directional notifications of events in web pages. Within a year, these changes, on average, nearly tripled the maximum number of persistent connections that web servers had to manage. This trend  definitely gave a strong impetus to the adoption of reverse proxies in front of slower web servers and it gave also one more chance to the emerging new web servers that could show all their speed and their capability to handle very high numbers of concurrent connections without requiring too many hardware resources .In 2015, RFCs published new protocol version , and as the implementation of new specifications was not trivial at all, a dilemma arose among developers of less popular web servers , about adding or not adding support for that new protocol version.In fact supporting HTTP/2 often required radical changes to their internal implementation due to many factors  and so a few developers of those web servers opted for not supporting new HTTP/2 version  also because of these main reasons:Instead, developers of most popular web servers, rushed to offer the availability of new protocol, not only because they had the work force and the time to do so, but also because usually their previous implementation of SPDY protocol could be reused as a starting point and because most used web browsers implemented it very quickly for the same reason.  Another reason that prompted those developers to act quickly was that webmasters felt the pressure of the ever increasing web traffic and they really wanted to install and to try - as soon as possible - something that could drastically lower the number of TCP/IP connections and speedup accesses to hosted websites.In 2020–2021 the HTTP/2 dynamics about its implementation  were partly replicated after the publication of advanced drafts of future RFC about HTTP/3 protocol.The following technical overview should be considered only as an attempt to give a few very limited examples about some features that may be implemented in a web server and some of the tasks that it may perform in order to have a sufficiently wide scenario about the topic.A web server program plays the role of a server in a client–server model by implementing one or more versions of HTTP protocol, often including the HTTPS secure variant and other features and extensions that are considered useful for its planned usage.The complexity and the efficiency of a web server program may vary a lot depending on :Although web server programs differ in how they are implemented, most of them offer the following common features.These are basic features that most web servers usually have.A few other more advanced and popular features  are the following ones.A web server program, when it is running, usually performs several general tasks, :Web server programs are able:

Once an HTTP request message has been decoded and verified, its values can be used to determine whether that request can be satisfied or not. This requires many other steps, including security checks.Web server programs usually perform some type of URL normalization  in order:The term URL normalization refers to the process of modifying and standardizing a URL in a consistent manner. There are several types of normalization that may be performed, including the conversion of the scheme and host to lowercase. Among the most important normalizations are the removal of "." and ".." path segments and adding trailing slashes to a non-empty path component."URL mapping is the process by which a URL is analyzed to figure out what resource it is referring to, so that that resource can be returned to the requesting client. This process is performed with every request that is made to a web server, with some of the requests being served with a file, such as an HTML document, or a gif image, others with the results of running a CGI program, and others by some other process, such as a built-in module handler, a PHP document, or a Java servlet."In practice, web server programs that implement advanced features, beyond the simple static content serving , usually have to figure out how that URL has to be handled, e.g.:One or more configuration files of web server may specify the mapping of parts of URL path  to a specific URL handler .When a web server implements one or more of the above-mentioned advanced features then the path part of a valid URL may not always match an existing file system path under website directory tree  because it can refer to a virtual name of an internal or external module processor for dynamic requests.Web server programs are able to translate an URL path , that refers to a physical file system path, to an absolute path under the target website's root directory.Website's root directory may be specified by a configuration file or by some internal rule of the web server by using the name of the website which is the host part of the URL found in HTTP client request.Path translation to file system is done for the following types of web resources:The web server appends the path found in requested URL  and appends it to the path of the  website root directory. On an Apache server, this is commonly /home/www/website . See the following examples of how it may result.URL path translation for a static file requestExample of a static request of an existing file specified by the following URL:The client's user agent connects to www.example.com and then sends the following HTTP/1.1 request:The result is the local file system resource:The web server then reads the file, if it exists, and sends a response to the client's web browser. The response will describe the content of the file and contain the file itself or an error message will return saying that the file does not exist or its access is forbidden.URL path translation for a directory request Example of an implicit dynamic request of an existing directory specified by the following URL:The client's user agent connects to www.example.com and then sends the following HTTP/1.1 request:The result is the local directory path:The web server then verifies the existence of the directory and if it exists and it can be accessed then tries to find out an index file  and so it passes the request to an internal module or a program dedicated to directory listings and finally reads data output and sends a response to the client's web browser. The response will describe the content of the directory  or an error message will return saying that the directory does not exist or its access is forbidden.URL path translation for a dynamic program requestFor a dynamic request the URL path specified by the client should refer to an existing external program  used by the web server to generate dynamic content.Example of a dynamic request using a program file to generate output:The client's user agent connects to www.example.com and then sends the following HTTP/1.1 request:The result is the local file path of the program :The web server executes that program, passing in the path-info and the query string action=view&orderby=thread&date=2021-10-15 so that the program has the info it needs to run. . In addition to this, the web server reads data sent from the external program and resends that data to the client that made the request.Once a request has been read, interpreted, and verified, it has to be managed depending on its method, its URL, and its parameters, which may include values of HTTP headers.In practice, the web server has to handle the request by using one of these response paths:If a web server program is capable of serving static content and it has been configured to do so, then it is able to send file content whenever a request message has a valid URL path matching  that of an existing file under the root directory of a website and file has attributes which match those required by internal rules of web server program.That kind of content is called static because usually it is not changed by the web server when it is sent to clients and because it remains the same until it is modified  by some program.NOTE: when serving static content only, a web server program usually does not change file contents of served websites  and so it suffices to support only these HTTP methods:Response of static file content can be sped up by a file cache.If a web server program receives a client request message with an URL whose path matches one of an existing directory and that directory is accessible and serving directory index file is enabled then a web server program may try to serve the first of known  static index file names  found in that directory; if no index file is found or other conditions are not met then an error message is returned.Most used names for static index files are: index.html, index.htm and Default.htm.If a web server program receives a client request message with an URL whose path matches the file name of an existing file and that file is accessible by web server program and its attributes match internal rules of web server program, then web server program can send that file to client.Usually, for security reasons, most web server programs are pre-configured to serve only regular files or to avoid to use special file types like device files, along with symbolic links or hard links to them.  The aim is to avoid undesirable side effects when serving static web resources.If a web server program is capable of serving dynamic content and it has been configured to do so, then it is able to communicate with the proper internal module or external program  in order to pass to it parameters of client request; after that, web server program reads from it its data response  and then it resends it to the client program who made the request.NOTE: when serving static and dynamic content, a web server program usually has to support also the following HTTP method in order to be able to safely receive data from client and so to be able to host also websites with interactive form that may send large data sets  to web server / external programs / modules:In order to be able to communicate with its internal modules and/or external programs, a web server program must have implemented one or more of the many available gateway interface .The three standard and historical gateway interfaces are the following ones.A web server program may be capable to manage the dynamic generation  of a directory index list of files and sub-directories.If a web server program is configured to do so and a requested URL path matches an existing directory and its access is allowed and no static index file is found under that directory then a web page , containing the list of files and/or subdirectories of above mentioned directory, is dynamically generated .  If it cannot be generated an error is returned.Some web server programs allow the customization of directory listings by allowing the usage of a web page template , $, etc., that are replaced with the field values of each file entry found in directory by web server), e.g. index.tpl or the usage of HTML and embedded source code that is interpreted and executed on the fly, e.g. index.asp, and / or by supporting the usage of dynamic index programs such as CGIs, SCGIs, FCGIs, e.g. index.cgi, index.php, index.fcgi.Usage of dynamically generated directory listings is usually avoided or limited to a few selected directories of a website because that generation takes much more OS resources than sending a static index page.The main usage of directory listings is to allow the download of files  as they are, without requiring to provide further information to requesting user.An external program or an internal module  can execute some sort of application function that may be used to get data from or to store data to one or more data repositories, e.g.:A processing unit can return any kind of web content, also by using data retrieved from a data repository, e.g.:In practice whenever there is content that may vary, depending on one or more parameters contained in client request or in configuration settings, then, usually, it is generated dynamically.Web server programs are able to send response messages as replies to client request messages.An error response message may be sent because a request message could not be successfully read or decoded or analyzed or executed.NOTE: the following sections are reported only as examples to help to understand what a web server, more or less, does; these sections are by any means neither exhaustive nor complete.A web server program may reply to a client request message with many kinds of error messages, anyway these errors are divided mainly in two categories:When an error response / message is received by a client browser, then if it is related to the main user request  then usually that error message is shown in some browser window / message.A web server program may be able to verify whether the requested URL path:If the authorization / access rights feature has been implemented and enabled and access to web resource is not granted, then, depending on the required access rights, a web server program:A web server program may have the capability of doing URL redirections to new URLs  which consists in replying to a client request message with a response message containing a new URL suited to access a valid or an existing web resource .URL redirection of location is used:Example 1: a URL path points to a directory name but it does not have a final slash '/' so web server sends a redirect to client in order to instruct it to redo the request with the fixed path name.From:
  /directory1/directory2
To:
  /directory1/directory2/Example 2: a whole set of documents has been moved inside website in order to reorganize their file system paths.From:
  /directory1/directory2/2021-10-08/
To:
  /directory1/directory2/2021/10/08/Example 3: a whole set of documents has been moved to a new website and now it is mandatory to use secure HTTPS connections to access them.From:
  http://www.example.com/directory1/directory2/2021-10-08/
To:
  https://docs.example.com/directory1/2021-10-08/Above examples are only a few of the possible kind of redirections.A web server program is able to reply to a valid client request message with a successful message, optionally containing requested web resource data.If web resource data is sent back to client, then it can be static content or dynamic content depending on how it has been retrieved .In order to speed up web server responses by lowering average HTTP response times and hardware resources used, many popular web servers implement one or more content caches, each one specialized in a content category.
Content is usually cached by its origin, e.g.:Historically, static contents found in files which had to be accessed frequently, randomly and quickly, have been stored mostly on electro-mechanical disks since mid-late 1960s / 1970s;  regrettably reads from and writes to those kind of devices have always been considered very slow operations when compared to RAM speed and so, since early OSs, first disk caches and then also OS file cache sub-systems were developed to speed up I/O operations of frequently accessed data / files.Even with the aid of an OS file cache, the relative / occasional slowness of I/O operations involving directories and files stored on disks became soon a bottleneck in the increase of performances expected from top level web servers, specially since mid-late 1990s, when web Internet traffic started to grow exponentially along with the constant increase of speed of Internet / network lines.The problem about how to further efficiently speed-up the serving of static files, thus increasing the maximum number of requests/responses per second , started to be studied / researched since mid 1990s, with the aim to propose useful cache models that could be implemented in web server programs.In practice, nowadays, many popular / high performance web server programs include their own userland file cache, tailored for a web server usage and using their specific implementation and parameters.

The wide spread adoption of RAID and/or fast solid-state drives  has slightly reduced but of course not eliminated the advantage of having a file cache incorporated in a web server.Dynamic content, output by an internal module or an external program, may not always change very frequently  and so, maybe for a while , the resulting output can be cached in RAM or even on a fast disk.The typical usage of a dynamic cache is when a website has dynamic web pages about news, weather, images, maps, etc. that do not change frequently  and that are accessed by a huge number of clients per minute / hour;  in those cases it is useful to return cached content too  because clients often do not have an updated copy of the requested content in their browser caches.Anyway, in most cases those kind of caches are implemented by external servers  or by storing dynamic data output in separate computers, managed by specific applications , in order to not compete for hardware resources  with web server.
A web server software can be either incorporated into the OS and executed in kernel space, or it can be executed in user space .Web servers that run in kernel mode  can have direct access to kernel resources and so they can be, in theory, faster than those running in user mode; anyway there are disadvantages in running a web server in kernel mode, e.g.: difficulties in developing  software whereas run-time critical errors may lead to serious problems in OS kernel.Web servers that run in user-mode have to ask the system for permission to use more memory or more CPU resources. Not only do these requests to the kernel take time, but they might not always be satisfied because the system reserves resources for its own usage and has the responsibility to share hardware resources with all the other running applications. Executing in user mode can also mean using more buffer/data copies  which can lead to a decrease in the performance of a user-mode web server.Nowadays almost all web server software is executed in user mode .  See also comparison of web server software to discover which of them run in kernel mode or in user mode .To improve the user experience , a web server should reply quickly  to client requests; unless content response is throttled  for some type of files , also returned data content should be sent as fast as possible .In other words, a web server should always be very responsive, even under high load of web traffic, in order to keep total user's wait  for a response as low as possible.For web server software, main key performance metrics  usually are at least the following ones :
Among the operating conditions, the number  of concurrent client connections used during a test is an important parameter because it allows to correlate the concurrency level supported by web server with results of the tested performance metrics.The specific web server software design and model adopted :... and other programming techniques, such as :... used to implement a web server program, can bias a lot the performances and in particular the scalability level that can be achieved under heavy load or when using high end hardware .In practice some web server software models may require more OS resources  than others to be able to work well and so to achieve target performances.There are many operating conditions that can affect the performances of a web server; performance values may vary depending on :Performances of a web server are typically benchmarked by using one or more of the available
automated load testing tools.A web server  usually has pre-defined load limits for each combination of operating conditions, also because it is limited by OS resources and because it can handle only a limited number of concurrent client connections .When a web server is near to or over its load limits, it gets overloaded and so it may become unresponsive.At any time web servers can be overloaded due to one or more of the following causes .The symptoms of an overloaded web server are usually the following ones .To partially overcome above average load limits and to prevent overload, most popular websites use common techniques like the following ones .Caveats about using HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 protocolsEven if newer HTTP  protocols usually generate less network traffic for each request / response data, they may require more OS resources  used by web server software ; besides this, HTTP/2 and maybe HTTP/3 too, depending also on settings of web server and client program, may not be the best options for data upload of big or huge files at very high speed because their data streams are optimized for concurrency of requests and so, in many cases, using HTTP/1.1 TCP/IP connections may lead to better results / higher upload speeds .Below are the latest statistics of the market share of all sites of the top web servers on the Internet by Netcraft.NOTE:  percentage rounded to integer number, because its decimal values are not publicly reported by source page .Standard Web Server Gateway Interfaces used for dynamic contents:A few other Web Server Interfaces  used for dynamic contents:
