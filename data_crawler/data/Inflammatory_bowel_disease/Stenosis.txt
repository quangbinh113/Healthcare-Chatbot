A stenosis  is an abnormal narrowing in a blood vessel or other tubular organ or structure such as foramina and canals. It is also sometimes called a stricture .Stricture as a term is usually used when narrowing is caused by contraction of smooth muscle ; stenosis is usually used when narrowing is caused by lesion that reduces the space of lumen . The term coarctation is another synonym, but is commonly used only in the context of aortic coarctation.Restenosis is the recurrence of stenosis after a procedure.The resulting syndrome depends on the structure affected.Examples of vascular stenotic lesions include:The types of stenoses in heart valves are:Stenoses/strictures of other bodily structures/organs include:Stenoses of the vascular type are often associated with unusual blood sounds resulting from turbulent flow over the narrowed blood vessel. This sound can be made audible by a stethoscope, but diagnosis is generally made or confirmed with some form of medical imaging.
