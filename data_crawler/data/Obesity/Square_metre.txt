The square metre  or square meter  is the unit of area in the International System of Units  with symbol m2. It is the area of a square with sides one metre in length.Adding and subtracting SI prefixes creates multiples and submultiples; however, as the unit is exponentiated, the quantities grow exponentially by the corresponding power of 10. For example, 1 kilometre is 103  times the length of 1 metre, but 1 square kilometre is 2  times the area of 1 square metre, and 1 cubic kilometre is 3  cubic metres.The square metre may be used with all SI prefixes used with the metre.Unicode has several characters used to represent metric area units, but these are for compatibility with East Asian character encodings and are not meant to be used in new documents.Instead, the Unicode superscript U+00B2 ²  can be used, as in m².One square metre is equal to:
