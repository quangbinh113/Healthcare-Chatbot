Hypertension Hypertension  High blood pressure in pregnancy can be classified as pre-existing hypertension, gestational hypertension, or pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia is a serious condition of the second half of pregnancy and following delivery characterised by increased blood pressure and the presence of protein in the urine.  It occurs in about 5% of pregnancies and is responsible for approximately 16% of all maternal deaths globally.  Pre-eclampsia also doubles the risk of death of the baby around the time of birth.  Usually there are no symptoms in pre-eclampsia and it is detected by routine screening.  When symptoms of pre-eclampsia occur the most common are headache, visual disturbance , vomiting, pain over the stomach, and swelling.  Pre-eclampsia can occasionally progress to a life-threatening condition called eclampsia, which is a hypertensive emergency and has several serious complications including vision loss, brain swelling, seizures, kidney failure, pulmonary edema, and disseminated intravascular coagulation  Hypertension Hypertension
